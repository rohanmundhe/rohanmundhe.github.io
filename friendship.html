                            <h2>Friendship In Hardship: How Shared Struggles Deepen Connections.</h2>
                            <p><span style="font-family: times;">Back in 2022, when I was in 10th grade, I only had a few casual friends; however, by the end of 12th grade, I had a large number of true devoted friends who were always available to aid me. You may have major questions such, "How Does This Wonderful Transformation Happen?" Before we get into this topic, I have a questions for you. Do You Have Friends Who Will Help You During Difficult Times? Are your existing friends always willing to help you ? Do you have any buddies who go through similar struggles?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">In the middle of 11th grade, I decided to make useful new friends, and from then I began to learn new friendship patterns and people's behaviours. I spent more than 20 hours each day with the people for 4-5 months. I came to understand that meaningful ties are formed as a result of mutual struggle. Since then, I've made new friends based on this rather than common interests, hobbies, or age group. As a result, I've developed genuine friendships with the people around me.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;"><br /></span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: times;">Role Of Oxytocin&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: times;">If you are going through a difficult time in your life and other people are going through the same thing, you may experience the release of the hormone oxytocin in your head. Oxytocin, also known as the "love hormone" or "bonding hormone," is essential for building relationships via shared challenges. When people encounter hardships together, oxytocin levels rise, resulting in stronger trust and connection.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">In times of stress, the brain releases oxytocin, which promotes social connection and encourages people to seek help from others. This can enhance the bond between persons going through difficult times.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">Oxytocin also increases empathy and compassion, making people more sensitive to others' feelings. This increased empathy allows people to better understand and assist one other during difficult situations, increasing strengthening their bond even further.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;"><br /></span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: times;">Beauty of Shared Struggle</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: times;">In the depths of mutual struggle, individuals form unshakable bonds. When faced with adversity, humans have a natural instinct to band together, support one another, and find strength.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">Imagine two friends, let's call them Raman and Roshan , who are both going through a difficult time in their lives. Raman has just failed to make to government engineering collage and is dropper, and Roshan is dealing with a serious downfall in engineering entrance exam. Despite their own challenges, they lean on each other for support. As they navigate through their hardships together, Raman and Roshan form a deep understanding of each other's pain and vulnerability. They become each other's pillars of strength, offering a listening ear, and words of encouragement.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;"></span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">If you form friendships with people who share this concept, it will be difficult to break the tie between you and your friend. Your friends will discover that you are the person who will help them in difficult times. In this scenario, people will always regard you as a genuine person with whom they will maintain a long-term relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;"><br /></span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: times;">Social media friendships lack depth and authenticity in times of hardship.</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: times;">Social media provides an environment for short-term experience and surface-level participation. Likes, comments, and shares flash across screens, yet they frequently fall short of capturing the true essence of human experience. These digital gestures are meaningless when faced with hardships; they are unable to fill the emotional gap.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">The essence of friendship under hardship rests in its depth, in an unconscious understanding that goes beyond words. It feeds on the warmth of physical presence, the comforting touch of a hand, and the shared silence that tells volumes. These are the characteristics of true partnership. True friendship, in its purest form, is measured not in likes or followers, but in the steady presence of a like-minded individual who stands firm in the face of hardship.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;"><br /></span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: times;">Summaries all&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: times;">1. Oxytocin, known as the "love hormone," is released during shared struggles, deepening connections. This hormone promotes trust, empathy, and bonding, leading to stronger relationships.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">2. Shared struggles allow individuals to better understand and support each other. This heightened empathy strengthens the bond between friends, creating a deeper connection.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">3. Friendship in hardship provides a support system where individuals can lean on each other for emotional support, encouragement, and strength. These shared experiences create an unbreakable bond.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">4. Social media friendships often lack depth and authenticity in times of hardship. Digital interactions cannot replace the warmth of physical presence, reassuring touch, and shared silence that true companionship offers.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">5.True friendship is not measured by likes or follows, but by the unwavering presence of a kindred spirit in times of adversity. The ability to stand steadfast and provide support during hardships is the essence of genuine friendship.</span></p><p><br /></p>
